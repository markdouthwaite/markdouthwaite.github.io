What is Artificial Intelligence?

\\ Patrick Winston - artificial intelligence 6034
So it's about algorithms enabled by constraints exposed by representations that model targeted thinking,
perception, and action.
The effort to automate intellectual tasks performed by humans.

\\ Software 2.0 can be written in much more abstract, human unfriendly language, such as the weights of a neural network
our approach is to specify some goal on the behavior of a desirable program (e.g., “satisfy a dataset of input output pairs of examples”, or “win a game of Go”), write a rough skeleton of the code (e.g. a neural net architecture), that identifies a subset of program space to search, and use the computational resources at our disposal to search this space for a program that works
The 2.0 programmers manually curate, maintain, massage, clean and label datasets; each labeled example literally programs the final system because the dataset gets compiled into Software 2.0 code via the optimization.

\\ francois chollet - deep learning
Machine learning, and especially deep learning, exhibits comparatively little mathematical theory ... and is engineering oriented.
The question opens the door to a new programming paradigm. In classical programming, humans input rules (a program) and data be processed according to these rules. With machine learning, humans input data as well as the answers expected. A machine learning system is trained rather than explicitly programmed.

Many aspects of their application are more art than a science. There is no systematic procedure that one can apply in navigating these design spaces. At the moment, the design process is more the result of trial-and-error experimentation, combined with rough intuitions that practitioners learn by experience.
